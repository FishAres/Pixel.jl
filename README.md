# Pixel.jl
Batteries-included generative art framework for Julia. Contributors welcome!

This project aspires to bring a friendly creative coding framework to Julia, in the spirit of Processing, P5Js, openFrameworks etc. 

## Why Julia?

a) It is my personal favorite language
b) Imagine all the cool art you could make with all the amazing scientific libraries O_O

## The niche:
Julia has many great graphics packages, but none of them have so far been developed into a batteries-included creative coding framework. 

## Things this project aims to support:

- A legible and functional-leaning API for 2D (and 3D?) graphics, without having to deal with mutable global state.
- Full user interaction, i.e. live mouse and keyboard input.
- Plug-and-play support for webcams and other peripherals.
- Extensibility: should provide primitives that enable easy abstractions without way too many lines of code
- Interop: ability to interact with any Julia library.


## Contribute

This project is still in the conceptual stage. Feel free to reach out if this project interests you, regardless of Julia fluency level (I am mediocre at best).
